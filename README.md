## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Open-Source Libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.

### üîß Jetpack & Android Libraries:
  - Jetpack Compose: Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
  - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - Kotlin Coroutines: A concurrency design pattern in Kotlin that simplifies asynchronous code, allowing you to write code that executes asynchronously in a sequential style.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
  - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation, complemented by [Hilt Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) for dependency injection.
  - Room: Constructs a database with an SQLite abstraction layer for seamless database access.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Facilitates dependency injection.
  - [lottie-Compose](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.airbnb.android/lottie-compose): allows developers to easily integrate Lottie animations into their Android apps using Jetpack Compose.
  - Shared element transitions : A seamless way to transition between composables that have content that is consistent between them.
  - datastore:Store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally, overcoming some of the drawbacks of SharedPreferences.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tooling
* **Architecture Pattern**:
  * **MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)**: Promotes clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable.
  * **Repository Pattern**: Acts as a single source of truth by abstracting data access from various sources (local or remote).

### üß∞ Additional Tools & Libraries:
* **[Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)**: Multiplatform, format-agnostic, reflectionless serialization library for Kotlin.
* **[KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)](https://github.com/google/ksp)**: Lightweight compiler plugin for annotation processing and code generation.
* **[Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine)**: A lightweight testing library for validating Kotlin Flows in unit tests.
* **[Baseline Profiles](https://medium.com/proandroiddev/improve-your-android-app-performance-with-baseline-profiles-297f388082e6)**: Optimizes runtime performance by pre-compiling critical code paths in your app.

## Architecture
**Task Manager** adheres to the MVVM architecture and implements the Repository pattern, aligning with [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09ca369a-968a-435e-bb89-f1856120bac5)

The architecture of **Pokedex Jetpack** is structured into two distinct layers: the UI layer and the data layer. Each layer fulfills specific roles and responsibilities, outlined as follows:

**Task Manager** follows the principles outlined in the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), making it an exemplary demonstration of architectural concepts in practical application.

### Architecture Overview

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29f555f6-2339-40dc-899c-79835b0c7fb7)

- Each layer adheres to the principles of [unidirectional event/data flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf): the UI layer sends user events to the data layer, and the data layer provides data streams to other layers.
- The data layer operates autonomously from other layers, maintaining purity without dependencies on external layers.

This loosely coupled architecture enhances component reusability and app scalability, facilitating seamless development and maintenance.

### UI Layer

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d123e6-e72b-4ca8-998b-a9edec78ae19)

The UI layer encompasses UI elements responsible for configuring screens for user interaction, alongside the [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), which manages app states and restores data during configuration changes.
- UI elements observe the data flow, ensuring synchronization with the underlying data layer.

### Data Layer

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdebc42-69a1-41a2-ad8f-d57d3cbf9124)

The data layer is composed of repositories that handle business logic tasks such as retrieving data from a local database or fetching remote data from a network. This layer is designed to prioritize offline access, functioning primarily as an offline-first repository of business logic. It adheres to the principle of "single source of truth," ensuring that all data operations are centralized and consistent.<br>

## Modularization

**Task Manager** adopted modularization strategies below:

- **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time.
- **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time.
- **Strict visibility control**: Modules restrict to expose dedicated components and access to other layers, so it prevents they're being used outside the module
- **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules.
